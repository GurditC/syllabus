# Test 2: Conditional Expectation, the BLP and Sampling 

This test, like the first is a timed assessment that we want you to take no more than 90 minutes to complete. The test will cover content from weeks 4 and 5. The structure of the test will be similar to the structure for the first test.

## How the test will be structured 

- We want you to take no more than 90 minutes to work on this test from the time you download it, to the time that you turn it back in. 
- Roughly the first 50% of the points on the test will be questions that ask you to recall and straightforward apply concepts from the reading, lectures and homework. Questions in this section might ask you to recall a concept, solve a simple problem, or solve a problem related to work that you've already completed in a homework.
- Roughly the second 50% of the points on the test will be questions that ask you to integrate your understanding. These questions will be longer, multi-part questions where we break a harder problem into smaller-aspects that are each assessed. For these questions, you should describe your process, because partial credit will be awarded. 
- The test will *not* be a race to complete; the test will *not* be a quiz-bowl to find arcane factoids that are buried in footnotes of the book; please do not let the test cause you undue stress.
