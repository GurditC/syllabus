There are two tests: 

1. [Probability Theory Test](./probability_theory_test.md)
2. [Conditional Expectation, Best Linear Predictor, and Sampling Test](./conditional_expectation_best_linear_predictor_sampling_test.md)

We have two goals with these tests. We have designed questions to allow you to demonstrate your capabilities on each of these goals. 

First, we want to provide you with an opportunity to show that you are able to recall course materials and put techniques into practice. Questions that assess your ability in this domain will be relatively straightforward: for example, we might ask you to compute the expected value of a random variable provided a pdf, or to report the conditional probability of an event. 

Second, we want to provide you with a chance to learn and show how you can integrate your understanding of the atomic concepts from the course into a larger, creative, or more cohesive answer to a challenging question or two. 

## What we have learned 
This semester, we are asking that you take your tests in a timed environment. We plainly acknowledge that this is an artificial environment. Nobody has ever said to anybody else: 

> Quick! Do this math, I need an answer in the next 60 minutes! 

But, there is a reason for this artificial constraint: Our goal is to provide you with a chance to review and integrate what you've learned from the weeks that we are testing. In the past, when we haven't provided a time constraint, we found our assessments were causing problems for students: the assessments were causing stress, leading students to take sick- and vacation-days off work to complete problems, and generally failing to help students integrate knowledge. 

## How the test will be structured 

- We want you to take no more than 90 minutes to work on this test from the time you download it, to the time that you turn it back in. 
- Roughly the first 50% of the points on the test will be questions that ask you to recall and straightforward apply concepts from the reading, lectures and homework. Questions in this section might ask you to recall a concept, solve a simple problem, or solve a problem related to work that you've already completed in a homework.
- Roughly the second 50% of the points on the test will be questions that ask you to integrate your understanding. These questions will be longer, multi-part questions where we break a harder problem into smaller-aspects that are each assessed. For these questions, you should describe your process, because partial credit will be awarded. 
- The test will *not* be a race to complete; the test will *not* be a quiz-bowl to find arcane factoids that are buried in footnotes of the book; please do not let the test cause you undue stress.
