# w203: Statistics for Data Science, UC Berkeley School of Information 

The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundational understanding of classical statistics and how it fits within the broader context of data science. Students will learn to apply the most common statistical procedures correctly, checking assumptions and responding appropriately when they appear violated. Emphasis is placed on different practices that constitute an effective analysis, including formulating research questions, operationalizing variables, exploring data, selecting hypothesis tests, and communicating results.

The course begins with an introduction to probability theory, with pencil-and-paper problem sets to develop intuition for the key concepts that underlie statistical models. Next, we use the simple example of the mean to demonstrate the use of estimators and hypothesis tests. We then turn to classical linear regression, taking several weeks to build a strong understanding of this central topic. Our treatment stresses causal inference and includes a discussion of omitted variables. At the end, we describe some of the concerns that arise in the process of specifying linear models. Throughout the course, students will practice analyzing real-world data using the open-source language `R`. 

# Course Prerequisites 

There are no formal prerequisites to enroll in this course. However, a familiarity with simple optimization through calculus, the general method of reasoning through math proofs, and an ability to read and reason about simple linear algebra will be helpful.

# Weekly Workflow 

- **Asynchronous Material** - This course closely ties the lecture material and course textbook. While a student can read the week's materials before attending the lectures, we have designed the lecture and reading so that there are tight "learning sprints" between reading, lecturing, and student activities. We would encourage students to schedule several hour-long sessions through the week where they read and watch lectures. 

- **Live Session Activities** - In live session, students engage in activities to reinforce and extend the materials they have studied. These will be discussions, math and programming exercises. We expect that you will have access to a quiet, study space for class, that you will arrive on time, and that you will be both connected to audio and video. Weâ€™re a community of students, and you are expected to engage in the community.

- **After Live Session** - After live session, students can work on homework, assessment, or lab/project work that correspond to the unit's work. 

# Course Materials 

## Required Textbooks 
- The main text for the class is *Foundations of Agnostic Statistics*, written by Peter M. Aronow and Benjamin T. Miller. A physical copy of the book is available for approximately $30 ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Agnostic-Statistics-Peter-Aronow/dp/1316631141), [Cambridge University Press Link](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/research-methods-politics/foundations-agnostic-statistics?format=PB)). As well, for individuals who would like to have a digital copy of the book, it is available through the UC Library ([link](https://doi-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1017/9781316831762)). We keep a physical copy as a desk reference. 

- The required, supplementary text for the course is *Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences*. We have pulled the key chapters that we will be using, and they are available for purchase (at a discount) through study.net. 

## Required Compute Resources 
Much of the work for this course can be completed on the [UC Berkeley datahub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/). Students may also run the course materials with the stable [`rocker/tidyverse`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse) image, or through a local install of [R](https://cran.rstudio.com) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
