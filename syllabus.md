# w203: Statistics for Data Science
## UC Berkeley School of Information 

The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundational understanding of classical statistics and how it fits within the broader context of data science. Students will learn to apply the most common statistical procedures correctly, checking assumptions and responding appropriately when they appear violated. Emphasis is placed on different practices that constitute an effective analysis, including formulating research questions, operationalizing variables, exploring data, selecting hypothesis tests, and communicating results.

The course begins with an introduction to probability theory, with pencil-and-paper problem sets to build intuition for the mathematical objects that comprise statistical models. Next, we describe the use of estimators to learn about model parameters, emphasizing guarantees that hold as sample sizes increase to infinity. We then turn to the logic of hypothesis testing and survey a variety of tests used to compare two groups.  Finally, we devote several weeks to a discussion of classical linear regression, stressing its flexibility as a tool.  We devote special units to the building of regression models in the context of description and of causal inference. Throughout the course, students will practice analyzing real-world data using the open-source language `R`. 

## Course Prerequisites 

- Proficiency with calculus (including an ability to take simple derivatives and integrals)
- Familiarity with basic matrix operations
- Ability to write proofs

## Weekly Workflow 

- **Before Live Session** - The first task for each unit is to complete the asynchronous videos and corresponding readings.  We recommend that you begin by watching the first videos.  As you work forward, you will encounter special "Reading" pages, which direct you to read specific pages in the textbooks.  Where possible, we have further organized each week into two or three "sprints." You may want to take a break after each sprint, or tackle each sprint on a separate day.  **It is important that you complete all videos and readings before live session.**

- **During Live Session** - In live session, students engage in activities that build upon the asynchronous videos and readings. These include discussions, collaborative problem solving, and programming exercises. We expect that you dial in from a quiet location, that you will arrive on time, and that you connect over both audio and video.  Most importantly, we ask that you treat all classmates with respect and help us create a supportive learning environment.

- **After Live Session** - After live session, students complete the homework for the corresponding unit, as well as any tests or lab assignments. 



## Required Textbooks 
- The main text for the class is *Foundations of Agnostic Statistics*, written by Peter M. Aronow and Benjamin T. Miller. A physical copy of the book is available for approximately $30 ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Agnostic-Statistics-Peter-Aronow/dp/1316631141), [Cambridge University Press Link](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/research-methods-politics/foundations-agnostic-statistics?format=PB)). As well, for individuals who would like to have a digital copy of the book, it is available through the UC Library ([link](https://doi-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1017/9781316831762)).

- There is a required course packet, which you may purchase at study.net.  This includes select chapters from other textbooks, namely *Probability and Statistics, 8th Edition* by Devore. 

## Required Compute Resources 
Much of the work for this course can be completed on the [UC Berkeley datahub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/). Students may also run the course materials with the stable [`rocker/tidyverse`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse) image, or through a local install of [R](https://cran.rstudio.com) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

## Grading 

Grading for the course will follow this rubric: 

| Component                   | Percentage | 
|-----------------------------|------------| 
| All Homework Combined       | 25%        | 
| Test 1: Probability Theory  | 10%        |
| Test 2: CE, BLP, & Sampling | 10%        |
| Hypothesis Testing Lab      | 20%        |
| Linear Regression Lab       | 25%        |
| Participation               | 10%        |

On homework, each question sub-part will be graded out of three points, for mastery. This means that: 

- (3 points): A sub-part that was fully correct and demonstrates that a student has mastery of that concept. 
- (2 points): A sub-part that has substantially correct work, but that has any error
- (1 point):  A sub-part that has been attempted, but has considerable errors
- (0 points): A sub-part that has either not been attempted, or has been attempted in a way that communicates no understanding of the concept. 

Students who are interested in knowing how to map percentage grades onto letter grades can use this table as a guideline: 

| Letter Grade | Percentage   |
| ------------ | ----------   |
| A            | x >= 93      |
| A-           | 90 <= x < 93 |
| B+           | 87 <= x < 90 |
| B            | 83 <= x < 87 |
| B-           | 80 <= x < 83 |
| C+           | 77 <= x < 80 |
| C            | 73 <= x < 77 |
| C-           | 70 <= x < 73 |
| Lower Grades | x < 70       |

## Late Policy 

We set deadlines for homework, tests, and labs to be completed. These deadlines are to your advantage, becacuse they help you to prioritize your learning. At the same time, we understand that MIDS a single facet of the life that you live. 

- **Homework**: Homework assignments are chances for you to apply the content that you have learned in the async and the live sessions. These occur at a regular (nearly weekly) pace. Homework is due _at the time that your live session meets_ on the day that it meets. 
  - Students have five "late days" that they can use without penalty on homework through the semester. After those "late days" have been used, each day late will be assessed a 10% penalty from the final grade of that homework assignment. As an example, after using all five late days, a homework assignment turned in one day late could earn a maximum score of a 90% _on that homework_. 
  - Students cannot turn in any single homework more than two days late. This balances the need for student flexibility, with the need to release feedback to other students in a section. For example, a student who has class on Monday at 4:00p cannot turn in an assignment later than Wednesday at 4:00p.
- **Tests**: Tests count for a larger proportion of the final course grade, and happen less frequently. As a result, we would like tests to be completed on time.
- **Labs**: The labs in the course are group projects. We will expect that labs are turned in for instructor review, in whatever state they are in, at the time they are due. 
  
We appreciate that these are challenging times. Please, be encouraged to talk with your instructor if you have a challenge that arises. We want to support your learning, not cause anxiety or stress. We will work with you to find an accomodation.
