# Description of Tests

- [[Link]](./tests/probability_theory_test.md) The probability test is a 90 minute test that reviews your learning on probability theory. 
- [[Link]](./tests/conditional_expectation_best_linear_predictor_sampling_test.md) The conditional expectation and best linear prediction test is a 90 minute test that reviews your continued learning on probability theory. 

# Description of Labs 

- [[Link]](./labs/testing_lab.md) Is a two-week long, group-project where you will write, explain, and justify hypothesis test that you conduct against data. 
- [[Link]](./labs/regression_lab.md) Is a three-week long, group-project where you will write, explain, and justify a series of linear models that you build to explain relationships in data.
